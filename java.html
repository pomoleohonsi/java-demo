    <ol>
        <li>Java is used in the manipulation of HTML and CSS</li>
        <li>In java i learnt that alphabets or numbers in quote are regarded as strings</li>
        <li>I learnt that when using var, you can only declare and assign multiple times, when using let,you
            can declare once and assign multiple times, but when using const, you can only declare once and
            assign once
